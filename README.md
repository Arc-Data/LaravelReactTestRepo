My last attempt at creating a Social Media Website, made with React and Tailwind and learning Laravel through this project as well. My ultimate goal for this project is to be able
to learn or at least be at the starting point for learning social media algorithms and develop a much needed understanding of why certain social media websites make certain UI decisions
and be able to come with a better idea of the kind of direction I want to take this application in.
